                    I'M A RECENT FIRST CLASS GRADUATE CURRENTLY SEEKING NEW OPPORTUNITIES!

                <p>I am a recent first-class graduate in computer science and Games Technology BSc.
                My attention to detail and genuine passion for engineering complex solutions are
                what makes programming continuously fascinating to me. My part-time remote 12 month internship with
                Eternal Construct helped me gain entry level experience with developing in C# and designing
                application architecture.</p>
                
                <p>Over the last couple of years, my skills in team management and relationship
                building have enhanced after my time abroad in Finland playing professional basketball. The rapid necessity
                to adapt to a new environment and culture really tested my ability to learn new things in many uncomfortable
                situations. This is what makes me stand out from other candidates.</p>
